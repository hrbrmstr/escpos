Description: ESC/POS devices, such as receipt printers, have the ability to print their own form of
    raster bitmap graphics as well as text. Tools are provided to turn {ggplot2} or {grid} objects 
    into such raster bitmaps and print them, along with text and regular impages, to ESC/POS
    compatible devices.
